# Learning Resources

This is a collection of resources I've found helpful while learning computer vision. Keeping this for future reference and for anyone else who might find it useful.

## Books

### Currently Reading
- **"Learning OpenCV 3" by Adrian Kaehler & Gary Bradski**
  - Comprehensive but sometimes dense
  - Good for understanding the theory behind algorithms
  - Examples are in C++ but concepts transfer to Python

### Want to Read
- "Programming Computer Vision with Python" by Jan Erik Solem
- "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski (available free online!)

## Online Courses & Tutorials

### Completed
- **OpenCV Course - Basics** (YouTube - freeCodeCamp)
  - Great introduction, covers installation and basic operations
  - Link: [bookmarked locally]

### Currently Following
- **PyImageSearch Blog** by Adrian Rosebrock
  - Extremely practical tutorials
  - Weekly blog posts on various CV topics
  - The tutorials on thresholding and contour detection were super helpful

### Bookmarked for Later
- CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Stanford)
- First Principles of Computer Vision (YouTube channel)

## Documentation

- **OpenCV Python Docs**: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html
  - The official docs - always my first stop
  - Sometimes examples are outdated (OpenCV 2 vs 3 vs 4 differences)
  
- **NumPy Docs**: Essential for understanding array operations

- **Matplotlib Docs**: For visualization

## YouTube Channels

1. **sentdex** - Python Programming tutorials
   - His OpenCV series is excellent
   - Easy to follow, practical examples

2. **Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI**
   - Short, focused tutorials
   - Good for quick learning of specific techniques

3. **First Principles of Computer Vision**
   - More theoretical but really deepens understanding

## Blogs & Websites

- **PyImageSearch**: https://pyimagesearch.com/
  - My go-to resource
  - Practical tutorials with code
  - Covers beginner to advanced topics

- **LearnOpenCV**: https://learnopencv.com/
  - Run by Satya Mallick
  - High-quality tutorials
  - Good explanations of theory

- **Stack Overflow**
  - Saved my life multiple times
  - Especially helpful for debugging OpenCV version compatibility issues

## Papers & Academic Resources

Haven't dove deep into papers yet, but keeping these bookmarked:

- "Canny Edge Detection" - Original paper by John Canny (1986)
- "SIFT: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform" - David Lowe (1999)

## Community

- **Reddit**: r/computervision - Good for discussions and questions
- **OpenCV Forum**: https://forum.opencv.org/ - Official support forum
- **Discord**: Computer Vision community servers

## GitHub Repositories

Inspiring repos I've found:

- opencv/opencv - The official repo, good for browsing examples
- spmallick/learnopencv - Code for LearnOpenCV tutorials
- PyImageSearch examples - Scattered across various repos

## Specific Topics

### Contour Detection
- PyImageSearch article on contour properties and filtering
- Stack Overflow: "Understanding contour hierarchy in OpenCV"
- OpenCV docs on findContours and drawContours

### Morphological Operations
- Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez & Woods (Chapter on Morphology)
- OpenCV tutorial on morphological transformations

### Thresholding
- OpenCV tutorial: "Image Thresholding"
- Understanding adaptive vs global thresholding (multiple blog posts)

## Tools & Software

- **Python 3.11** - Current version I'm using
- **OpenCV 4.x** (opencv-python package)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - For experimentation and visualization
- **VS Code** - My IDE of choice with Python extension
- **Git** - Version control (still learning best practices)

## Tips from Experience

1. **Start with official docs** - They're comprehensive even if sometimes dry
2. **Follow along with code** - Don't just read, type it out and experiment
3. **Break things intentionally** - Best way to learn what each parameter does
4. **Keep a journal** - Document what works and what doesn't
5. **Join communities** - Don't hesitate to ask questions
6. **Compare multiple sources** - Different explanations help understanding
