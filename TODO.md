- [ ] Image classification project
- [ ] Semantic segmentation

### Advanced Topics

- [ ] Gesture recognition

## Improvements to Existing Projects

### Mouse Draw Circle
- [ ] Add color selection (keyboard shortcuts)
- [ ] Add brush size controls
- [ ] Implement eraser
- [ ] Save drawing to file
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality

### Contour Detection
- [ ] Filter contours by area (remove tiny noise contours)
- [ ] Draw bounding boxes around contours
- [ ] Calculate and display contour properties (area, perimeter)
- [ ] Shape detection (identify triangles, squares, circles)
- [ ] Try on different types of images

### Edge Detection
- [ ] Add Scharr operator comparison
- [ ] Parameter tuning with trackbars (interactive)
- [ ] Real-time edge detection with webcam
- [ ] Combine with contour detection

### Morphological Operations
- [ ] Add Opening and Closing operations
- [ ] Try different structuring elements (cross, ellipse)
- [ ] Apply to real-world image cleanup tasks
- [ ] Text extraction preprocessing

## Learning Resources to Check Out

### Courses
- [ ] CS231n videos (Stanford)
- [ ] Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera)
- [ ] PyImageSearch Plus membership (maybe?)

### Books to Finish
- [ ] Complete "Learning OpenCV 3" (currently at chapter 5)
- [ ] Start "Programming Computer Vision with Python"

### Papers to Read
- [ ] YOLO paper
- [ ] R-CNN family papers
- [ ] U-Net for segmentation

## Repository Improvements

- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Create video demos of projects
- [ ] Write blog posts about learning journey
- [ ] Add badges to README (Python version, license, etc.)
- [ ] Set up proper requirements.txt at root level
- [ ] Add automated testing (learn pytest)
- [ ] Better organize code (utils module?)

## Ideas for Mini-Projects

1. **Color Palette Extractor**: Extract dominant colors from images
2. **Blur Detector**: Detect if image is blurry (useful for quality control)
3. **Image Alignment**: Align multiple photos of same scene
4. **Barcode Scanner**: Detect and decode barcodes
5. **Emoji Filter**: Add emoji overlays on faces (fun project!)
6. **Document Scanner**: Take photo → perspective correct → enhance
7. **Green Screen Replacement**: Replace background color
8. **Cartoonify Effect**: Make photos look like cartoons
9. **Photo Mosaic**: Create mosaic from many small images
10. **Parking Space Detector**: Detect empty parking spots

## Questions to Explore

- When to use classical CV vs deep learning?
- How to optimize for real-time performance?
- What's the difference between various feature detectors?
- How does color space affect different operations?
- Best practices for preprocessing pipelines?

## Collaboration Ideas

- [ ] Contribute to OpenCV docs (fix typos, add examples)
- [ ] Answer questions on Stack Overflow
- [ ] Share projects on Reddit/Twitter
- [ ] Write tutorials based on my learning
