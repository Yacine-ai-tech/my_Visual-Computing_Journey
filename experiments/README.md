# Experiments Directory

This folder contains quick experiments and tests I did while learning. Code here is **not production quality** - it's messy, sometimes broken, but kept for reference.

## What's Here

- `threshold_tests.py` - Comparing different thresholding methods (simple, Otsu's, adaptive)
- `blur_kernel_tests.py` - Testing how blur kernel size affects edge detection
- More experiments to come as I try new things...

## Purpose

This is my playground for:
- Testing parameters without worrying about clean code
- Comparing different approaches side-by-side
- Understanding what each parameter actually does
- Failing fast and learning from mistakes

## Notes

If something doesn't run or gives weird results, that's intentional. These are experiments, not finished projects. I keep them to remember what I tried and why I chose certain approaches in my main projects.

*Don't judge the code quality here - it's a learning mess!*
