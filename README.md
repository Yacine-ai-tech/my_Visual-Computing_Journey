# Visual Computing Projects

A collection of computer vision and image processing projects using OpenCV and Python.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various computer vision and image processing techniques, organized by category.

## Projects

### Image Processing
- **morphological_operations** - Image morphological transformations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing)
- **edge_detection** - Edge detection algorithms (Canny, Sobel, Laplacian)

### Computer Vision
- **contour_detection** - Contour detection and boundary analysis

### Interactive Tools
- **mouse_draw_circle** - Interactive drawing with mouse events

### Experiments
- Various experimental implementations and tests

## Getting Started
